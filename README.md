My app is able to change the color of text and display the color RGB at the bottom of the app.
First i added a library 'com.github.yukuku:ambilwarna:2.0.1' which adds colorwheel support. Ialso had to import
view, button, editText, and TextView. I then start the main onCreate method and set the main layout. Then i start 
Color method. This method sets up the button and nextlayout. We then start the onClickListener. In this you override a 
onClick. I then made the new text field and then found 3 random numbers for RGB. I then set the text as these colors
This repeats as many times as you press the button. Then I attempted part two and only got the layout switch and
colorwheel working.
The way to run my project is to import it into visual studio. once imported you should build it using the green 
hammer. After that you will run the application and create a virtual device. Select this device and the project will
run. You can then push the buttons and work the application.
